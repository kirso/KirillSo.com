Contrary to most of the world, I decided to write my annual review on my birthday (thanks to Phan Tanh for inspiration). In hindsight, it makes total sense. Why would you reflect on your experiences based on society's notion of a calendar year? I was born in April and hence that's a full year for an individual.

I've also struggled to write 

And lastly, I completely revamped the direction by not focusing on goals. Ironically the person who helped me with this is

I took inspiration from Pham Tanh this year and decided to write a review on my birthday, since that seems like a real cutoff. Another year flew by and I started receiving annual life updates from random people I follow. The best part is, it's really fun to read! If you wonder what these are, [Ximena Vengoechea](https://www.ximenavengoechea.com/) wrote a great article on life audits where she defines it as:

> An exercise in self-reflection that helps you clear the cobwebs of noisy, external goals and current distractions, and revisit or uncover the real themes & core values that drive & inspire you. **Also known as spring cleaning for the soul.**

I find this exercise helpful, mainly because the "auto-mode" switches on when we get too busy. Then suddenly, a few months (or years later) we wake up to the bells of dissatisfaction, or even worse, a blurry image of what is left of our year.

In 2022, [I attempted](/annual-review-2021) to summarise my year, which took me a few weeks. In 2023 I wrote a review based on a template that we just too deep. It wasn't a pleasant experience, so I tweaked the process a little. In 2023 I wrote a review but never published it. It was too long and, I didn't feel it was interesting enough to read. Hence, this year I created a template with a timeline of events, photos, and life areas like career, growth, money, relationships, etc.,

For the sake of this article, I kept it very simple. It answers fundamental:

- What went well? (Highlights)
- What didn't go well? (Lowlights)
- What did I learn? (Lessons)
- Core memories
- Systems & Values

## TL;DR

2023 was a year of **stability**. My whole life has been defined by big changes, moving to different countries, hustling, and starting from scratch. Specifically, since I set sail and moved to Singapore it has been an unending set of career changes, visa stress, and overall change.

This year has been defined by cementing my professional position at work, focusing on life experiences, reaching personal milestones and

## What went well?

### I got married

### Travel and personal life experiences

### Stability (with a caveat)

## What didn't go well?

### Auto-mode

When the review time came, it was really hard for me to recall all the major things that had happened.
