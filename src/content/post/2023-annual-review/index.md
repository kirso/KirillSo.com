## Prologue

In 2022, [I attempted](/posts/annual-review-2021) to summarize my year for the first time. I did ok and it was a pleasurable activity.

In 2023, despite having good intentions I made a mistake and went too deep. Instead of looking forward to summarise my learnings I just wanted to be done with it which is far from a "reflective goal". This also created a mental wall and disconnected from the thinking state I wanted to be in.

This year I didn’t learn the lesson. I used the same template and dreaded every moment but pushed through. With the same outcome of not being proud of what I’ve done despite sinking 10 hours into the process. I frankly hated it.

So I went out on a search and tried to find if anyone else feels the same way. It appears some dude called [Andrew Askins](https://www.andrewaskins.com/2023-year-in-review-plus-free-notion-template/) shared a similar experience in his blog post. He also managed to simplify it.

Hence, instead of boring you with 9 areas of my life that made me feel cringe, I’d like to go with an alternative to simplify. After all, whoever is reading this is either a person who wants to know if they are ahead, or my wife.

### The why

If you wonder why to even spend time doing something like this, [Ximena Vengoechea](https://www.ximenavengoechea.com/) wrote a great article on life audits where she defines it as:

> An exercise in self-reflection that helps you clear the cobwebs of noisy, external goals and current distractions, and revisit or uncover the real themes & core values that drive & inspire you. **Also known as spring-cleaning for the soul.**

### The structure

- [Learnings](#learnings)
- Core memories (Moments of awe)
- Systems & values

### TLDR

2023 was a year of **stability** and **experiences** and such as every year there were both upsides and downsides.

I had major life events happen, including making the most important decision of my life as well as unintentionally creating lots of memories. I travelled a lot, and it felt like the old days, just without all the meetings I had to go to as it wasn’t related to my job. Furthermore, I focused on my health, eating habits and gym consistency, whilst trying to carve out some time for nourishing some of my life’s most significant relationships after the long hiatus of post-COVID world.

Overall it has been a very good year, not without challenges but as usual I learned a lot…

## Highlights

### Getting married

They say who you marry will pretty much dictate the quality of your life.

Well last year in May, [Sarah](www.sarahkhanamajid.com) and I, decided to make it official and signed papers at a local ROM (registry of marriage) in Singapore. We didn’t have a proper ceremony yet, which is planned for this year and will only appear as a life event in the next review.

Our relationship has been defined by randomness that turned into fast-track boot camp in 2020 where we moved in together in the middle of the pandemic. We were isolated from the outside world for at least a year in a small studio apartment in the east of Singapore. Despite that fact and being very early in, we managed to make it work, in fact it was really fun.

When the borders opened, we started to finally enjoy what other couples usually start with. Dates, travels, restaurants, and hangouts with friends.

I am incredibly humbled and grateful that I have a person in my life who is kind, generous, supportive, and full of infectious optimism and zest for life. As her sister likes to say, she brings “color” into my life.

### Experiences

Wow, this has been incredible. I’ve never travelled so much (outside of work) in one year although to similar destinations within SEA but still with enough newness to make it worthwhile!

### Stability (with a caveat)

## Lowlights

### Auto-mode

When the review time came, it was really hard for me to recall all the major things that had happened.

### Growth

A few personal

## Learnings

- I might not be the great entrepreneur, but I love buildings products.
- I am drained by bullshit work and politics (PowerPoint decks, synchronous meeting culture, admin) and anything that seems meaningless and pointless.
- Simple & married life suits me. I feel responsible for another human being on a daily basis, which grounds me.
- Being part of a small community of souls that resonate around niche topics (people who are on non-default paths, hackers building tiny products, local gym bros and gals).
- Energized by nature and green. Being in the city can get depressing despite the convenience.
- Being comfortable and complacent increases fragility and dependency which in effect produces stress.

### General

- I learned a lot about how networks and the internet work at a low level in my time at GreyNoise.
- I learned that I can survive a big professional failure, and that as long as I live by my values and treat people with respect that will ultimately be more important to the surrounding people than the failure was.

### What I changed my mind

## Systems (for 2024)

### 2023 Goals

#### Theme

I did pretty well with my 2023 goals. Hiking the Camino, surprising Maddy, and sticking to Spanish lessons for most of the year were big achievements. I didn’t climb as much as I had intended, but I did pick up weightlifting for a bit and really enjoyed that again. And I don’t think I built emotional resilience, or at least not at the level I would like to have gotten to. But I did weather some big life changes and challenges, so that is really the only way to practice. Hell

### 2024 Goals
