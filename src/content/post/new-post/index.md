The reason we

As you decide what to write about, consider a topic that may be confusing to others,but simple to you. Here are some examples:

- Options trading
- The inner workings of regenerative agriculture
- The meaning of your favorite poem
- The significance of Palm Sunday in the Catholic faith
- How to make sourdough from scratch
- The origin of the imperial system of measurement
- Secrets of greenwashing in the beauty industry
- All the different ways a star can die

As you write, ask yourself: How would I explain this to a child? How can I take a complex idea and turn it into something clear and concise?

Use the practice of writing as a mode of thinking. It will help you figure out what you're trying to say. Most likely, it will be uncomfortable. You'll have to wade through complexity before you arrive at simplicity. But slowly, as writing forces you to think deeply and structure your thoughts, your Shiny Dime will emerge.
