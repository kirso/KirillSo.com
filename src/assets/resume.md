# Kirill Sofronov CV

## SUMMARY

I am a hands-on product management and growth executive with 13+ years of experience in tech organizations ranging from seed-stage startups to post-IPO companies. In the past, I worked on renewable energy, ran a profitable agency & co-founded a startup. Occasionally, I build tiny products, write, and mentor. I try to cultivate a beginner’s mind and focus on lifelong learning.
